# PWA Offline Google Map Starter

## Jump Right In

- A PWA with offline capabilities. It contains ONLY two pages: page 1 contains google map with some pins, when clicking on any pin, the user will be taken to page 2, which contains a form to fill-up (the form has textbox, radio-group, checkbox, â€¦ etc). In the online mode, the user can upload the filled-up forms through API or download new pins on the map. Please let us know if you can help. Regards,
